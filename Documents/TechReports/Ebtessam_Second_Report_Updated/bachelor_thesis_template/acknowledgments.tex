I would like to express my greatest gratitude to the people who have helped & supported me throughout my project. I am grateful to my supervisor Georg Jung for his continuous support for the project, from initial advice in the early stages of conceptual inception & through ongoing advice & encouragement to this day. 

A special thank of mine goes to my project partner Ahmed Sabbah who helped bring this idea to life.

I would also like to thank the Arduino developers community as they were extremely helpful and supportive.
