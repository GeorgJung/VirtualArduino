Virtual Arduino is a desktop application that simulates the Arduino board. It is an educational tool aims to provide hands-on experience for embedded systems programming and hardware beginners. This includes writing, verifying and uploading Arduino code. It should also include building hardware circuits to connect with the Arduino. The interactive simulator will help the user visualize the output of the code and the hardware failure scenarios make it more like real-life. These concepts give Virtual Arduino an edge over other simulators out there.
