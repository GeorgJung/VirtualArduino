The use of microcontrollers is becoming more popular year by year. Nearly all devices now have microcontrollers. They even invented a \href{http://www.inquisitr.com/270421/goal-line-technology-being-tested-by-fifa-ifab/}{soccer ball with a built-in microchip}. Microcontroller boards are widely used for educational purposes in universities. they are considered an efficient way to learn and practice embedded systems programming, as it provides hands-on experience to the user. However, many university students do not have access to these boards as they are expensive. The challenge nowadays is to decrease this cost. we provide a real time simulator for a popular microcontroller board, the \href{http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno}{Arduino Uno}. This simulator provides an experience as close as possible to the actual board. Using this simulator, the user can write Arduino code, compile and upload it to a simulated Arduino Uno board. He can also implement circuit simulators, add virtual hardware components and connect them to the virtual board. The simulator also provides visualization for the output that the Arduino board produces on the circuits and hardware components. Through this application, the user has the opportunity to learn most of the phases of working with microcontrollers.
