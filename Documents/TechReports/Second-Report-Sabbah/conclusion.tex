\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:concl}


Hands-on experience is essential for students learning embedded system programming. Some students do not have access to microcontroller boards because of cost. A real time hardware simulation including all aspects of embedded system is a perfect solution to this problem. Students that use this application can gain most of the experience. They can write code, implement circuits and connect hardware components covering all aspect of embedded system programing.
