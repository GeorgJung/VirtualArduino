The use of microcontroller is becoming more popular year by year. They are built inside a surprising number of products these days. All modern automobiles contain at least one microcontroller, any device that has a remote control almost certainly contains one. Microcontroller boards are widely used for educational purposes in universities. It is considered an efficient way to learn and practice embedded systems programming, as it provides hands-on experience to the user. Many university students do not have access to these boards because of cost problem. The challenge nowadays is to decrease this cost. Our proposal is to make a real time simulator for a popular microcontroller board, \href{http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno}{Arduino Uno}. This simulator provides an experience as close as possible to real life. Using this simulator, the user can write Arduino code, compile and upload it to a simulated Arduino Uno board. He can also implement circuits, add hardware components and connect them to the board. The simulator also provides visualization for the output the Arduino board produces on the circuits and hardware components. Through this application, the user learns most of the phases of working with microcontrollers.
